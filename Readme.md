# Design Patterns

This project is a collection of design pattern examples.

I did not write most of this code, but modified it from the examples at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ .

The design patterns are based on the book, "Erich Gamma/Richard Helm/Ralph Johnson/John Vlissides, Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-
Oriented Software".
